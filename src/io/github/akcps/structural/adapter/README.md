# Adapter Pattern

This pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. 
It allows classes to work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

### Example
There are 2 objects defined
1. Duck 
- quack()
- fly()

2. Turkey
- gobble()
- fly()

WAP to convert 
1. duck to turkey
2. turkey to duck
