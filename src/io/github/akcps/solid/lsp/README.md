# Liskov Substitution Principle

- Any derived class should be able to substitute its parent class without the consumer knowing it.
- Every class that implements an interface, must be able to substitute any reference, must be able to substitute any reference thorough out the code that implements the same interface.
- Every part of the code should get the expected result no matter what instance of a class you send to it, given it implements the same interface.
