# Prototype Pattern

- Object creation is slow and expensive(resource intensive) and we need a bunch of object
- Saves client from creating a similar object again and over again
- Create once and then clone from the created object


### WAP to create a Book Store system
1. A Book Store has many books
2. The system has many book stores
3. Each book store has similar set of initial books

NOTE: the constraint is thar creating the initial set of books is expensive.
